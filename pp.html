Eligibility.\n\n
You are not authorized to create an account or access or use the Service or systems it resides on unless all of the following are true:\n
•	you are at least 18 years of age.\n
•	you are not a person who is barred from using the Service under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction (for example, you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition)\n
•	you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations\n
•	you have never been convicted of a felony or indictable offense (or crime of similar severity), a sex crime, or any crime involving violence, and that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender registry.
Online Safety\n
•	Never Send Money or Share Financial Information\n
Never send money, especially over wire transfer, even if the person claims to be in an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash — it’s nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace where the money went. Never share information that could be used to access your financial accounts. If another user asks you for money, report it to us immediately.

•	Protect Your Personal Information\n
Never share personal information, such as your social security number, home or work address, or details about your daily routine (e.g., that you go to a certain gym every Monday) with people you don’t know. If you are a parent, limit the information that you share about your children on your profile and in early communications. Avoid sharing details such as your children’s names, where they go to school, or their ages or genders.
•	Stay on the Platform\n
Keep conversations on the platform while you’re getting to know someone. Because exchanges on are subject to our Safe Message Filters (learn more here), users with bad intentions often try to move the conversation to text, messaging apps, email, or phone right away.
•	Be Wary of Long Distance and Overseas Relationships\n
Watch out for scammers who claim to be from your country but stuck somewhere else, especially if they ask for financial help to return home. Be wary of anyone who will not meet in person or talk on a phone/video call—they may not be who they say they are. If someone is avoiding your questions or pushing for a serious relationship without meeting or getting to know you first — that’s a red flag.
•	Report All Suspicious and Offensive Behavior\n\n
You know when someone’s crossed the line and when they do, we want to know about it. Block and report anyone that violates our terms. Here are some examples of violations:\n\n
o	Requests for money or donations\n
o	Underage users\n
o	Harassment, threats, and offensive messages\n
o	Inappropriate or harmful behavior during or after meeting in person\n
o	Fraudulent profiles\n
o	Spam or solicitation including links to commercial websites or attempts to sell products or services\n
You can report any concerns about suspicious behavior from any profile page or messaging window here. For more information, check out our Community Guidelines.\n
•	Protect Your Account\n
Be sure to pick a strong password, and always be careful when logging into your account from a public or shared computer. Will never send you an email asking for your username and password information — if you receive an email asking for account information, report it immediately.\n\n

By using the Service, you agree that you will not:\n
•	use the Service for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by this Agreement.\n
•	use the Service for any harmful or nefarious purpose\n

•	use another member\'s account, share an account with another member, or maintain more than one account.\n
•	create another account if we have already terminated your account, unless you have our permission.\n
Service reserves the right to investigate and/or terminate your account without a refund of any purchases if you have violated this Agreement, misused the Service or behaved in a way that Service regards as inappropriate or unlawful, including actions or communications that occur on or off the Service\n\n

Children\'s Privacy\n\n
